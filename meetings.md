# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 31.1.2024**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### Minutes

We went through the different sections in the "*RESTful API description*"-wiki page, with Mika making short comments about each one. After reviewing the basic project idea, he recommended focusing on one board game initially to meet project requirements on time. He was doubtful about the safety of sending game rules through the API. However, we were planning from the beginning to make move validation and game rules purely server-side.

Additionally, Mika identified several sections as missing or insufficient, which are outlined below as action points.


### Action points

- Add motivation for our project idea

- Diagram should visualize our project's concepts and their relations, not the system's architecture or endpoints

- Lichess API Client example should be more detailed
